#===== Config file containing samples ==========================================
# This gets appended to config


# Genome to use for analysis
# * The specified genome must have a config file present in pipelines/ref
GENOME:
    "hg38"
 
# Sample groups. 
# The sample names must match the beginning of a fastq file in one of the
# directories listed under RAW_DATA. If the sample name
# matches multiple fastqs, an error will be thrown.

# optional arguments:
#   --gtf GTF             An annotation of genes and transcripts in GTF format.
# --b1 B1               BAM configuration file.
# --b2 B2               BAM configuration file.
# --od OD               output folder of post step.
# -t {paired,single}    readtype, single or paired.
# --libType {fr-unstranded,fr-firststrand,fr-secondstrand}
# --libType options are based on TopHat --library-type. 
  # For fr-unstranded, the strand of the alignment is not checked. 
  # For fr-firststrand and fr-secondstrand, the strand is determined for each read and the strand is checked against the annotated strand for the gene. 
  # For fr-firststrand and fr-secondstrand, paired reads must be aligned to opposite strands. 
  # For fr-secondstrand the aligned strand of the first read is used as the original strand. 
  # For fr-firststrand, the aligned strand of the first read is not used as the original strand and instead the other strand is used as the original. 
  # According to the salmon library format fr-firststrand is ISR and fr-secondstrand is ISF
# --readLength READLENGTH
# The length of each read.
# --nthread NTHREAD     The number of thread. The optimal number of thread
# should be equal to the number of CPU core.
