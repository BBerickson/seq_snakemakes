ORIENTATION:
    "R2R1" # R1R2 
    
# optional arguments:
# -t {paired,single}    readtype, single or paired.
# --libType {fr-unstranded,fr-firststrand,fr-secondstrand}
# --libType options are based on TopHat --library-type. 
  # For fr-unstranded, the strand of the alignment is not checked. 
  # For fr-firststrand and fr-secondstrand, the strand is determined for each read and the strand is checked against the annotated strand for the gene. 
  # For fr-firststrand and fr-secondstrand, paired reads must be aligned to opposite strands. 
  # For fr-secondstrand the aligned strand of the first read is used as the original strand. 
  # For fr-firststrand, the aligned strand of the first read is not used as the original strand and instead the other strand is used as the original. 
  # According to the salmon library format fr-firststrand is ISR and fr-secondstrand is ISF
# --readLength READLENGTH
  # The length of each read.
